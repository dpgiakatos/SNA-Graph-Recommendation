# Dataset

The dataset of our project is MovieLens. For developing we will use a subsampling of the dataset. The link can be found [here](https://github.com/srviest/movie-recommender/tree/master/dataset/movielens/small). The dataset for production can be found [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

Note: The development dataset is preloaded in the project. You do not need to download.
